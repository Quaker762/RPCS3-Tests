# RPCS3 Test Suite
Contains projects (.self/.elf) for testing various functions of the rpcs3 emulator. Still VERY rudimentary. 

# Building (Everybody's favourite part -,-)
1. Install Visual Studio 2010 (**CANNOT BE EXPRESS EDITION**)
2. Make sure you have Version 4.0 of the PS3 SDK installed, and the path defined (the installer should do this for you)
3. Open the .sln
4. Right click which project you want to build and click 'rebuild'
